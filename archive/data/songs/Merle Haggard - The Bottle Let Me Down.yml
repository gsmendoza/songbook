lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      Each night I leave the bar room when it's over
      Not feeling any pain at closing time
      But tonight your memory found me much too sober
      Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind

  - Chorus: |
      Tonight the bottle let me down
      And let your memory come around
      The one true friend I thought I'd found
      Tonight the bottle let me down

  - Verse: |
      I've always had a bottle I could turn to
      And lately I've been turnin' every day
      But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
      And I'm hurtin' in old familiar ways

  - Chorus
