lyrics:
  - Instructions: |
      Capo on 1st fret

  - Intro: |
      ...

  - Verse 1: |
       Finally I figured out
       But it took a long, long time
       But now there's a turnabout
       Maybe cause I'm trying

  - Refrain: |
      There's been times, I'm so confused
      All my roads, they lead to you
      I just can't turn
      And walk away

  - Chorus: |
      It's hard to say what it is I see in you
      Wonder if I'll always be with you
      But words can't say, and I can't do
      Enough to prove,
      it's all for you

  - Verse 2: |
      I thought I'd seen it all
      Cause it's been a long, long time
      But then we'll trip and fall
      Wondering if I'm blind

  - Refrain

  - Chorus

  - Bridge: |
      Rain comes pouring down
      Falling from blue skies
      Words without a sound
      Coming from your eyes

  - Solo: |
      ...

  - Verse 1
