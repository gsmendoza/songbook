Merle Haggard - The Bottle Let Me Down

Verse

Each night I leave the bar room when it's over    | I--- ----
Not feeling any pain at closing time              | I--- V---
But tonight your memory found me much too sober   | V--- ----
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind     | V--- I---

Chorus

Tonight the bottle let me down                    | I--- ----
And let your memory come around                   | I--- V---
The one true friend I thought I'd found           | V--- ----
Tonight the bottle let me down                    | V--- I---

Verse

I've always had a bottle I could turn to          | I--- ----
And lately I've been turnin' every day            | I--- V---
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to | V--- ----
And I'm hurtin' in old familiar ways              | V--- I---

Repeat Chorus
