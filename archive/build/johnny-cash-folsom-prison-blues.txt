Verse

I hear the train a comin', it's rolling round the bend                  | I--- ----
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,                  | I--- ----
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on                  | IV--- ---- I--- ----

Verse

When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,                            | I--- ----
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.                        | I--- ----
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die                          | IV--- ---- I--- ----
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry..              | V7--- ---- I---

Verse

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car                   | I--- ----
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.                | I--- ----
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free                     | IV--- ---- I--- ----
But those people keep a movin' and that's what tortures me...           | V7--- ---- I---

Verse

Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine | I--- ----
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line                     | I--- ----
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay                     | IV--- ---- I--- ----
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.....               | V7--- ---- I---
