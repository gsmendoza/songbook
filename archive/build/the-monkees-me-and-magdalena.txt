Verse

Me And Magdelena                                        | IV--- I/iii---
We're driving south through Monterey                    | I--- I---
There's the sun a slowly sinking                        | IV--- I/iii---
into a distant ocean wave                               | I--- I---

Chorus 1

And I don't know if I've ever loved any other           | V- IV- I--- I---
Half as much as I do in this light she's under          | V- IV- I--- I---

Verse

Tell me Magdelena                                       | IV--- I/iii---
What do you see in the depths of your night             | I--- I---
Do you see your long lost father                        | IV--- I/iii---
Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child | I--- I---

Chorus

But know everything lost will be recovered              | V- IV- I--- I---
When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered        | V- IV- I--- I---
And I don't know if I've ever loved any other           | vi- IV- I--- I---
Half as much as I do in this light she's under          | V- IV- I--- I---

Verse

Me and Magdelena                                        | IV--- I/iii---
Always leaving early and sleeping late                  | I--- I---
Secluded in the canyon                                  | IV--- I/iii---
Lost within a turn of fate                              | I--- I---

Repeat Chorus
