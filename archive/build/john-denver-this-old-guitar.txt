John Denver - This Old Guitar

Verse

This old guitar taught me to sing a love song                        | I- V- vi- iii-
It showed me how to laugh and how to cry                             | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
It introduced me to some friends of mine and brightened up some days | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
It helped me make it through some lonely nights                      | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
Oh what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night                  | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
-                                                                    | IV- V-

Verse

This old guitar gave me my lovely lady                               | I- V- vi- iii-
It opened up her eyes and ears to me                                 | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
It brought us close together and I guess it broke her heart          | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
It opened up the space for us to be                                  | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
What a lovely place and a lovely space to be                         | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
-                                                                    | IV- V-

Verse

This old guitar gave me my life my living                            | I- V- vi- iii-
All the things you know I love to do                                 | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
To serenade the stars that shine from a sunny mountainside           | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
Most of all to sing my songs for you                                 | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
I love to sing my songs for you, yes I do you know                   | IV- V- I V6/vii vi vi/V
I love to sing my songs for you                                      | IV- V-
