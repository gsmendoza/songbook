Marvin Gaye - Heard It Through The Grapevine

Verse

I bet you're wonderin' how I knew                                | i7---
'Bout your plans to make me blue                                 | V7- IV7-
With some other guy you knew before                              | i7---
Between the two of us guys, you know I loved you more            | V7- IV7-

Refrain

It took me by surprise I must say                                | vi7- IV7-
When I found out yesterday                                       | i7- IV7-

Chorus

Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine             | i7---
Not much longer would you be mine                                | IV7---
Oh I heard it through the grapevine                              | i7---
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind, Honey, honey yeah.            | IV7---

Post-Chorus

I heard it through the grapevine                                 | i7--- ----
Not much longer would you be mine baby                           | 

Verse

I know a man ain't supposed to cry                               | i7---
But these tears I can't hold inside                              | V7- IV7-
Losin' you would end my life you see                             | i7---
'Cause you mean that much to me                                  | V7- IV7-

Refrain

You could have told me yourself                                  | vi7- IV7-
That you loved someone else                                      | i7- IV7-

Chorus

Instead I heard it through the grapevine                         | i7---
Not much longer would you be mine                                | IV7---
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine                             | i7---
And I'm just about to lose my mind, honey, honey yeah            | IV7---

Post-Chorus

I heard it through the grapevine                                 | i7--- ----
Not much longer would you be mine, baby                          | 

Verse

People say believe half of what you see                          | i7---
Son and none of what you hear                                    | V7- IV7-
But I can't help but be confused                                 | i7---
If it's true please tell me dear                                 | V7- IV7-

Refrain

Do you plan to let me go                                         | vi7- IV7-
For the other guy you loved before?                              | i7- IV7-

Chorus

Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine                  | i7---
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah                     | IV7---
I heard it through the grapevine                                 | i7---
I'm just about to lose my mind                                   | IV7---
Honey, honey, yeah                                               | 

Post-Chorus

I heard it through the grapevine,                                | i7--- ----
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah, honey, honey, yeah |
