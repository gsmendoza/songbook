...                                              | I--- I- V7-

Verse

Well the South side of Chicago                   | I---
is the baddest part of town                      | II---
And if you go down there you better just beware  | III7- IV-
Of a man named Leroy Brown                       | V IV I V7

Verse

Now Leroy more than trouble                      | I---
you see he stand about six foot four             | II---
All the downtown ladies call him treetop lover   | III7- IV-
All the men just call him sir                    | V IV I V7

Chorus

And he bad, bad Leroy Brown                      | I---
The baddest man in the whole damned town         | II---
Badder than old King Kong                        | III7- IV-
And meaner than a junkyard dog                   | V IV I V7

Verse

Now Leroy, he a gambler                          | I---
and he like his fancy clothes                    | II---
And he like to wave his diamond rings            | III7- IV-
in front of everybody's nose                     | V IV I V7

Verse

He got a custom Continental,                     | I---
he got an Eldorado too                           | II---
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun,           | III7- IV-
he got a razor in his shoe                       | V IV I V7

Repeat Chorus


Verse

Now Friday 'bout a week ago                      | I---
Leroy shootin' dice                              | II---
And at the edge of the bar sat a girl name Doris | III7- IV-
and oo, that girl looked nice                    | V IV I V7

Verse

Well he cast his eyes upon her                   | I---
and the trouble soon began                       | II---
Leroy Brown learned a lesson 'bout messin'       | III7- IV-
With the wife of a jealous man                   | V IV I V7

Repeat Chorus


Verse

Well the two men took to fighting                | I---
And when they pulled them from the floor         | II---
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle                | III7- IV-
With a couple of pieces gone.                    | V IV I V7

Repeat Chorus
