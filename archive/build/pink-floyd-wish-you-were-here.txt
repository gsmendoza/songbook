Verse

So, so you think you can tell                                       | IV--- V---
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.                             | ii--- I---
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?                  | V9--- IV---
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?                     | ii--- I---

Verse

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?                   | IV--- V---
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?                     | ii--- I---
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange                           | V9--- IV---
a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?                | ii--- I---

Verse

How I wish, how I wish you were here.                               | IV--- V---
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, | ii--- I---
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?               | V9--- IV---
The same old fears. Wish you were here.                             | ii--- I---
