Intro

...                                                                            | I- v- IV- I-
...                                                                            | I- V- VIIb- I-

Verse

Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone                          | I- v- IV- I-
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you                                  | I- V- VIIb---
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song                           | I- v- IV- I-
I just can't remember who to send it to                                        | I- V- VIIb---

Chorus

I've seen fire and I've seen rain                                              | IV- ii- I---
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end                            | IV- ii- I---
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend                          | IV- ii- I---
But I always thought that I'd see you again                                    | VIIb- v- I---

Verse

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus, You've got to help me make a stand         | I- v- IV- I-
You've just got to see me through another day                                  | I- V- VIIb---
My body's aching and my time is at hand                                        | I- v- IV- I-
And I won't make it any other way                                              | I- V- VIIb---

Repeat Chorus


Verse

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun           | I- v- IV- I-
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around                | I- V- VIIb---
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come | I- v- IV- I-
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground                       | I- V- VIIb---

Repeat Chorus


Outro

Thought I'd see you one more time again                                        | VIIb- v- I---
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now                  | VIIb- v- I---
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now . . .              | VIIb- v- I---
