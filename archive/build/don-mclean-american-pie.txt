Don Mclean - American Pie

Verse (First)

A long, long time ago                              | <G> <D> <Em>-
I can still remember                               | <Am>- <C>-
how that music used to make me smile.              | <Em>- <D>---
                                                   | 
And I knew if I had my chance                      | <G> <D> <Em>-
that I could make those people dance               | <Am>- <C>-
and maybe they'd be happy for a while.             | <Em>- <C>- <D>---
                                                   | 
But February made me shiver                        | <Em>- <Am>-
with every paper I'd deliver.                      | <Em>- <Am>-
Bad news on the doorstep.                          | <C> <G> <Am>-
I couldn't take one more step.                     | <C>- <D>-
                                                   | 
I can't remember if I cried                        | <G> <D> <Em>-
when I read about his widowed bride,               | <C>- <D>-
Something touched me deep inside                   | <G> <D> <Em>-
the day the music died.                            | <C>- <D>- <G>---

Chorus

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.                     | <G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry, | <G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-
them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,  | <G>- <C>- <G>- <D>-
singing this'll be the day that I die,             | <Em>--- <A7>---
This'll be the day that I die.                     | <Em>--- <D>--- ----

Did you write the book of love                     | <G>- <Am>-
and do you have faith in God above?                | <C>- <Am>-
If the Bible tells you so                          | <Em>- <D>---
                                                   | 
Now do you believe in rock and roll?               | <G> <D> <Em>-
Can music save your mortal soul?                   | <Am>- <C>-
and can you teach me how to dance real slow?       | <Em>- <A7>- <D>---
                                                   | 
Well I know that you're in love with him           | <Em>- <D>-
'cause I saw you dancing in the gym,               | <Em>- <D>-
You both kicked off your shoes,                    | <C> <G> <A7>-
Man I dig those rhythm and blues!                  | <C>- <D7>-
                                                   | 
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck,              | <G> <D> <Em>-
with a pink carnation and a pick-up truck.         | <Am>- <C>-
But I knew I was out of luck                       | <G> <D> <Em>-
the day, the music died.                           | <C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G> <D>
I started singing                                  |

Now for ten years, we've been on our own           | <G>- <Am>-
and moss grows fat on a rolling stone,             | <C>- <Am>-
But that's not how it used to be.                  | <Em>- <D>---
                                                   | 
Cause when the jester sang for the King & Queen    | <G> <D> <Em>-
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean              | <Am>- <C>-
and a voice that came from you and me              | <Em>- <A7>- <D>---
                                                   | 
Oh and while the king was looking down             | <Em>- <D>-
the jester stole his thorny crown                  | <Em>- <D>-
the court room was adjourned                       | <C> <G> <A7>-
no verdict was returned.                           | <C>- <D7>-
                                                   | 
And while Lennon read a book on Marx               | <G> <D> <Em>-
the quartet practiced in the park                  | <Am>- <C>-
and we sang dirges in the dark                     | <G> <D> <Em>-
the day the music died                             | <C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G> <D>
I started singin'                                  |

Helter skelter in the summer swelter               | <G>- <Am>-
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter          | <C>- <Am>-
Eight miles high and falling fast                  | <Em>- <D>---
                                                   | 
It landed foul on the grass                        | <G> <D> <Em>-
he players tried for a forward pass                | <Am>- <C>-
with the jester on the sidelines in a cast         | <Em>- <A7>- <D>---
                                                   | 
The half time air was sweet perfume                | <Em>- <D>-
while the seargeants played a marching tune        | <Em>- <D>-
we all got up to dance                             | <C> <G> <A7>-
but we never got the chance.                       | <C>- <D7>-
                                                   | 
'Cause the players tried to take the field,        | <G> <D> <Em>-
but the marching band refused to yield             | <Am>- <C>-
Do you recall what was revealed                    | <G> <D> <Em>-
the day the music died.                            | <C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G> <D>
I started singin'                                  |

And there we were all in one place,                | <G>- <Am>-
A generation lost in space.                        | <C>- <Am>-
With no time left, to start again.                 | <Em>- <D>---
                                                   | 
So come on, Jack be nimble, jack be quick,         | <G> <D> <Em>-
Jack flash sat on a candlestick.                   | <Am>- <C>-
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend.            | <Em>- <A7>- <D>---
                                                   | 
And as I watched him on the stage                  | <Em>- <D>-
my hands were clenched in fists of rage.           | <Em>- <D>-
no angel born in hell                              | <C> <G> <A7>-
could break that satan's spell                     | <C>- <D7>-
                                                   | 
And as the flames climbed high into the night      | <G> <D> <Em>-
to light the sacrificial rite                      | <Am>- <C>-
I saw Satan laughing with delight,                 | <G> <D> <Em>-
the day the music died.                            | <C>- <D>- <G> <C> <G> <D>
we were singin'                                    |

Verse (Last)

I met a girl who sang the blues                    | <G> <D> <Em>-
so I asked her for some happy news                 | <Am>- <C>-
but she just smiled and turned away.               | <Em>- <D>---
                                                   | 
I went down to the sacred store.                   | <G> <D> <Em>-
Where I heard the music years before.              | <Am>- <C>-
But the man there said the music wouldn't play.    | <Em>- <C>- <D>---
                                                   | 
And in the streets the children screamed,          | <Em>- <D>-
the lovers cried and the poets dreamed.            | <Em>- <D>-
But not a word was spoken.                         | <C> <G> <Am>-
The church bells all were broken.                  | <C>- <D>-
                                                   | 
And the three men I admire most:                   | <G> <D> <Em>-
the father, Son and the Holy Ghost                 | <C>- <D>-
They caught the last train for the coast           | <G> <D> <Em>-
the day, the music died.                           | <C>- <D>- <G>---
And they were singing                              |
