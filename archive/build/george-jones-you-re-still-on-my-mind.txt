Verse

The jukebox is playing a honky tonk song                     | <A>--- <D>---
One more I keep saying and then I'll go home                 | <E>--- <A>---
What good would it do me I know what I'll find               | <A>--- <D>---
An empty bottle of broken hearts and you're still on my mind | <E>--- <E>- <A>---

Verse

The people are laughing and having their fun                 | <A>--- <D>---
While I sit here crying over what you have done              | <E>--- <A>---
My pockets are empty my last drink of wine                   | <A>--- <D>---
An empty bottle of broken hearts and you're still on my mind | <E>--- <E>- <A>---

Instrumental

...                                                          | <E>--- <E>- <A>---

Verse

Alone and forsaken so blue I could die                       | <A>--- <D>---
I just sit here drinking till the bottle runs dry            | <E>--- <A>---
To try and forget you I turn to the wine                     | <A>--- <D>---
An empty bottle of broken hearts and you're still on my mind | <E>--- <E>- <A>---
