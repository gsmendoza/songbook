  - Verse: |
      Don't ask me
      What you know is true
      Don't have to tell you
      I love your precious heart

  - Chorus: |
      I
      I was standing
      You were there
      Two worlds collided
      And they could never tear us apart

  - Break: |
      ...

  - Verse: |
      We could live
      For a thousand years
      But if I hurt you
      I'd make wine from your tears

  - Verse: |
      I told you
      That we could fly
      Cause we all have wings
      But some of us don't know why

  - Chorus: |
      I
      I was standing
      You were there
      Two worlds collided
      And they could never, ever, tear us apart

  - Chorus: |
      I (Don't ask me)
      I was standing (You know it's true)
      You were there (Worlds collided)
      Two worlds collided (Shining through)
      And they could never tear us apart
