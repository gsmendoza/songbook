  - Verse: |
      Someone told me long ago
      There's a calm before the storm,
      I know; it's been coming
      for some time.

  - Verse: |
      When it's over, so they say
      It'll rain a sunny day,
      I know; shining down
      like water.

  - Chorus : |
      I want to know
      Have you ever seen the rain?
      I want to know
      Have you ever seen the rain
      Coming down on a sunny day?

  - Verse: |
      Yesterday, and days before,
      Sun is cold and rain is hard,
      I know; been that way
      for all my time.

  - Verse: |
      'Til forever, on it goes
      Through the circle, fast and slow,
      I know; it can't stop,
      I wonder.
