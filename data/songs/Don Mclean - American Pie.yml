lyrics:
  - Verse (First): |
      A long, long time ago
      I can still remember
      how that music used to make me smile.

      And I knew if I had my chance
      that I could make those people dance
      and maybe they'd be happy for a while.

      But February made me shiver
      with every paper I'd deliver.
      Bad news on the doorstep.
      I couldn't take one more step.

      I can't remember if I cried
      when I read about his widowed bride,
      Something touched me deep inside
      the day the music died.

  - Chorus: |
      So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
      Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
      them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
      singing this'll be the day that I die,
      This'll be the day that I die.

  - Verse (Fast): |
      Did you write the book of love
      and do you have faith in God above?
      If the Bible tells you so

      Now do you believe in rock and roll?
      Can music save your mortal soul?
      and can you teach me how to dance real slow?

      Well I know that you're in love with him
      'cause I saw you dancing in the gym,
      You both kicked off your shoes,
      Man I dig those rhythm and blues!

      I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck,
      with a pink carnation and a pick-up truck.
      But I knew I was out of luck
      the day, the music died.
      I started singing

  - Chorus

  - Verse (Fast): |
      Now for ten years, we've been on our own
      and moss grows fat on a rolling stone,
      But that's not how it used to be.

      Cause when the jester sang for the King & Queen
      in a coat he borrowed from James Dean
      and a voice that came from you and me

      Oh and while the king was looking down
      the jester stole his thorny crown
      the court room was adjourned
      no verdict was returned.

      And while Lennon read a book on Marx
      the quartet practiced in the park
      and we sang dirges in the dark
      the day the music died
      I started singin'

  - Chorus

  - Verse (Fast): |
      Helter skelter in the summer swelter
      the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
      Eight miles high and falling fast

      It landed foul on the grass
      he players tried for a forward pass
      with the jester on the sidelines in a cast

      The half time air was sweet perfume
      while the seargeants played a marching tune
      we all got up to dance
      but we never got the chance.

      'Cause the players tried to take the field,
      but the marching band refused to yield
      Do you recall what was revealed
      the day the music died.
      I started singin'

  - Chorus

  - Verse (Fast): |
      And there we were all in one place,
      A generation lost in space.
      With no time left, to start again.

      So come on, Jack be nimble, jack be quick,
      Jack flash sat on a candlestick.
      'Cause fire is the devil's only friend.

      And as I watched him on the stage
      my hands were clenched in fists of rage.
      no angel born in hell
      could break that satan's spell

      And as the flames climbed high into the night
      to light the sacrificial rite
      I saw Satan laughing with delight,
      the day the music died.
      we were singin'

  - Chorus

  - Verse (Last): |
      I met a girl who sang the blues
      so I asked her for some happy news
      but she just smiled and turned away.

      I went down to the sacred store.
      Where I heard the music years before.
      But the man there said the music wouldn't play.

      And in the streets the children screamed,
      the lovers cried and the poets dreamed.
      But not a word was spoken.
      The church bells all were broken.

      And the three men I admire most:
      the father, Son and the Holy Ghost
      They caught the last train for the coast
      the day, the music died.
      And they were singing

  - Chorus

  - Chorus (Last): |
      So bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
      Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry,
      them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye,
      singing this'll be the day that I die.
