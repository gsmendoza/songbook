  - Verse: |
      So, so you think you can tell
      Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
      Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
      A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

  - Verse: |
      Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
      Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
      Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
      a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

  - Verse: |
      How I wish, how I wish you were here.
      We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
      Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
      The same old fears. Wish you were here.
