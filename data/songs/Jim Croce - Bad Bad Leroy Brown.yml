lyrics:
  - Intro: |
      ...

  - Verse: |
      Well the South side of Chicago
      is the baddest part of town
      And if you go down there you better just beware
      Of a man named Leroy Brown

  - Verse: |
      Now Leroy more than trouble
      you see he stand about six foot four
      All the downtown ladies call him treetop lover
      All the men just call him sir

  - Chorus: |
      And he bad, bad Leroy Brown
      The baddest man in the whole damned town
      Badder than old King Kong
      And meaner than a junkyard dog

  - Verse: |
      Now Leroy, he a gambler
      and he like his fancy clothes
      And he like to wave his diamond rings
      in front of everybody's nose

  - Verse: |
      He got a custom Continental,
      he got an Eldorado too
      He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun,
      he got a razor in his shoe

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      Now Friday 'bout a week ago
      Leroy shootin' dice
      And at the edge of the bar sat a girl name Doris
      and oo, that girl looked nice

  - Verse: |
      Well he cast his eyes upon her
      and the trouble soon began
      Leroy Brown learned a lesson 'bout messin'
      With the wife of a jealous man

  - Chorus

  - Verse: |
      Well the two men took to fighting
      And when they pulled them from the floor
      Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
      With a couple of pieces gone.

  - Chorus
