lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      Our hearts, are free
      So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
      I'm the flower, you're the bee
      It's much older than you and me
      I'm in love, I'm in life
      I belong to the stars and sky
      Let's forget who we are for one night
      We're like animals baby it's the people and I

  - Chorus : |
      I want real love, baby, ooh don't leave me wating
      I got real love, baby, waiting til you taste me
      I want real love, baby, there's a world inside me
      Got the key just use it, just before I'm in it
