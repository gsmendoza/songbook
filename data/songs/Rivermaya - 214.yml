  - Verse: |
      Am I real? Do the words I speak before you make you feel
      That the love I have for you will see no ending?
      Well, if you look into my eyes then you should know

  - Verse: |
      That there is nothing here to doubt, nothing to fear
      And you can lay your questions down 'cause if you'll hold me
      We can fade into the night and you'll know

  - Chorus: |
      The world could die and everything may lie
      Still you shan't cry
      'Cause time may pass but longer than it'll last
      I'll be by your side

  - Segway: |

  - Verse: |
      Take my hand and gently close your eyes so you could understand
      That there's no greater love tonight than what I've for you
      Well, if you feel the same way for me then let go

  - Verse: |
      We can journey to a garden no one knows
      Life is short, my darling, tell me that you love me
      So we can fade into the night and you'll know

  - Chorus: |
      The world could die and everything may lie
      Still you shan't cry
      'Cause time may pass and everything won't last
      But I'll be by your side, forever by your side

  - Chorus (Last): |
      Forever by your side
      So you won't cry
