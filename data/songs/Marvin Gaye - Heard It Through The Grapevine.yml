lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
      'Bout your plans to make me blue
      With some other guy you knew before
      Between the two of us guys, you know I loved you more

  - Refrain: |
      It took me by surprise I must say
      When I found out yesterday

  - Chorus: |
      Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
      Not much longer would you be mine
      Oh I heard it through the grapevine
      Oh I'm just about to lose my mind, Honey, honey yeah.

  - Post-Chorus: |
      I heard it through the grapevine
      Not much longer would you be mine baby

  - Verse: |
      I know a man ain't supposed to cry
      But these tears I can't hold inside
      Losin' you would end my life you see
      'Cause you mean that much to me

  - Refrain: |
      You could have told me yourself
      That you loved someone else

  - Chorus: |
      Instead I heard it through the grapevine
      Not much longer would you be mine
      Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
      And I'm just about to lose my mind, honey, honey yeah

  - Post-Chorus: |
      I heard it through the grapevine
      Not much longer would you be mine, baby

  - Verse: |
      People say believe half of what you see
      Son and none of what you hear
      But I can't help but be confused
      If it's true please tell me dear

  - Refrain: |
      Do you plan to let me go
      For the other guy you loved before?

  - Chorus: |
      Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine
      Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
      I heard it through the grapevine
      I'm just about to lose my mind
      Honey, honey, yeah

  - Post-Chorus: |
      I heard it through the grapevine,
      Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah, honey, honey, yeah

  - Post-Chorus: |
      I heard it through the grapevine,
      Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah yeah

  - Post-Chorus: |
      I heard it through the grapevine,
      Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah yeah
