  - Verse: |
      Me And Magdelena
      We're driving south through Monterey
      There's the sun a slowly sinking
      into a distant ocean wave

  - Chorus 1: |
      And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
      Half as much as I do in this light she's under

  - Verse: |
      Tell me Magdelena
      What do you see in the depths of your night
      Do you see your long lost father
      Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child

  - Chorus: |
      But know everything lost will be recovered
      When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered
      And I don't know if I've ever loved any other
      Half as much as I do in this light she's under

  - Verse: |
      Me and Magdelena
      Always leaving early and sleeping late
      Secluded in the canyon
      Lost within a turn of fate

  - Chorus
