  - Verse: |
      The jukebox is playing a honky tonk song
      One more I keep saying and then I'll go home
      What good would it do me I know what I'll find
      An empty bottle of broken hearts and you're still on my mind

  - Verse: |
      The people are laughing and having their fun
      While I sit here crying over what you have done
      My pockets are empty my last drink of wine
      An empty bottle of broken hearts and you're still on my mind

  - Verse: |
      Alone and forsaken so blue I could die
      I just sit here drinking till the bottle runs dry
      To try and forget you I turn to the wine
      An empty bottle of broken hearts and you're still on my mind
