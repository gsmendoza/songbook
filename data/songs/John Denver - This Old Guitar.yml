lyrics:
  - Verse: |
      This old guitar taught me to sing a love song
      It showed me how to laugh and how to cry
      It introduced me to some friends of mine and brightened up some days
      It helped me make it through some lonely nights
      Oh what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night
      -

  - Verse: |
      This old guitar gave me my lovely lady
      It opened up her eyes and ears to me
      It brought us close together and I guess it broke her heart
      It opened up the space for us to be
      What a lovely place and a lovely space to be
      -

  - Verse: |
      This old guitar gave me my life my living
      All the things you know I love to do
      To serenade the stars that shine from a sunny mountainside
      Most of all to sing my songs for you
      I love to sing my songs for you, yes I do you know
      I love to sing my songs for you
