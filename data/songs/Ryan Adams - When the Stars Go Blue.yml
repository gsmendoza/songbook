lyrics:
  - Instructions: |
      Capo on 3rd fret

  - Verse: |
      Dancin where the stars go blue
      Dancin where the evening fell
      Dancin in your wooden shoes
      In a wedding gown

  - Verse: |
      Dancin out on 7th street
      Dancin through the underground
      Dancin little marionette
      Are you happy now?

  - Refrain: |
      Where do you go when you're lonely?
      Where do you go when you're blue?
      Where do you go when you're lonely?
      I'll follow you

  - Chorus: |
      When the stars go blue
      When the stars go blue
      When the stars go blue
      When the stars go blue

  - Verse: |
      Laughing with your pretty mouth
      Laughing with your broken eyes
      Laughing with your lover's tongue
      In a lullabye

  - Refrain

  - Chorus
